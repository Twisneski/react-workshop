# React and Redux - A Beginner's Introduction  

## Environment Setup
For those who are able to bring a laptop, here are instructions on setting up your computer in advance. These cover installing some software and a text editor, downloading the code repository, and how to confirm the code environment is running as expected. This will help free up internet bandwidth and time for instruction.  
<br />
If you don't have time to do this in advance or the instructions don't make sense, no worries! Find one of the organizers (Lisa French, Eliza Brock Marcum, Beck Cronin Dixon, or William Golden) when you get to the meeting and we can get you set up during the socializing time at the beginning of the meeting.  
<br />
Please complete the following machine setup in advance if possible:
 * Download a code text editor that supports JSX and [install the appropriate plugin](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Complementary-Tools#jsx-integrations). 
  * I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io), [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com), or [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). Atom is free. SublimeText and Webstorm  offer free trials. All three run on Windows and Mac.
 * Open the command line app
  * Instructions for Mac "Terminal" command line app: http://www.wikihow.com/Get-to-the-Command-Line-on-a-Mac
  * Instructions for Windows "Command Prompt" command line app: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window
 * Install the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  * Currently, that's v6.2.1
  * If you need to have multiple versions of Node installed, I recommend Node Version Manager - [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
 * Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 * Configure [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
 * In the command line app, navigate to the location/folder where you want to keep this code repository. (Hint: you will use the "ls" and "cd" commands for this.)
 * In the command line app, clone the repository by entering: ```git clone https://github.com/egdelwonk/react-workshop.git```
 * In the command line app, navigate into the newly cloned folder.
 * In the command line app, install the dependencies by entering `cd react-workshop` and then run `npm install`.
 * In the command line app, run the starter kit by entering `npm start`. This will start the development webserver.
 * In your browser, enter [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in the address bar. If you see the text "Welcome to react-workshop!", you're all set!
 * Get ready to learn!
